 What-are-the-types-of-Electric-Vehicles-
 
There are three types of electric vehicles categorized by the amount or degree that electricity is used as a source of power.

1). HEVs Hybrid Electric Vehicles
2). PHEVs Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles
3). BEVs/AEVs Battery Electric Vehicles/All-Electric Vehicles  

1). HEVs Hybrid Electric Vehicles
The hybrid electric vehicle has both a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) and an electric-powered propulsion system. HEVs use both petrol and electricity as power, HEVs startup using electric motor then the petrol engine takes over as the speed rises.
In this the batteries are charged by its regenerative braking system, this system is a mechanism that recovers the energy by slowing down a moving vehicle, which converts kinetic energy into electrical energy, which is stored in batteries or supercapacitors, or the energy is directly used by the motor in some vehicles.

Both the Internal combustion engine and electric motor are controlled by computer software which ensures the best fuel economy and leads to fewer tailpipe emissions as compared to traditional vehicles with an internal combustion engine.
